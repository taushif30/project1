    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>
      Backtracking is a form of recursion.<br /><br />
      The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you
      must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new
      set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice
      you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final
      state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal
      state; if you didn't, it isn't.<br /><br />
      Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some
      good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all
      good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning
      with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and vou keep
      this uo until vou get to a leaf.<br /><br />
      Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search
      for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the
      next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the
      choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end
      up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be
      found.<br /><br />
      This needs an example
    </p>

    <img src="./Image_root.png" />
    <ol>
      <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
      <br />
      <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C</li>
      <br />
      <li>C is bad.Go back to A.</li>
      <br />
      <li>At A,you have already tried C,and it failed.Try D</li>
      <br />
      <li>D is bad .Go back to A</li>
      <br />
      <li>At A,you have no options left to try .Go back to Root.</li>
      <br />
      <li>At Root,you have already tried A.try B.</li>
      <br />
      <li>At B,your options are E and f.Try E.</li>
      <br />
      <li>E is good.Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model
      of the possible sequences of choices we could make, There is also a data
      structure calied a tree, but usually we dont have a data structure to tell
      us what choices we have. (if we do have an actual tree data structure,
      backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching)
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>The Backtracking Algorithm</h2>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4">
        boolean solved(Node n){
            if n is a leaf node{
                if the leaf is a goal node,return true
                else return false
            } else {
                for each child c of n{
                    if solved(c) succeeds, return true
                }
                return false
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <br /><br />

    <p>
      Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is
      essential to understanding the algorithm. If solve (n) is true, that means
      node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a
      path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If
      solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>How does this work?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If any child of n is solvable,then n is solvable</li>
      <br />
      <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path
      to a goal node),all you have to do is test whether any child of n is
      solvable. This is done recursively , on each child of n. In the above
      code, this is done by the lines.
    </p>
    <br />
    <pre style="color: #007eb4">
        for each child c of n {
            if solved(c) succeeds, return true
        }
        return false
    </pre>
    <p>
      Eventually the recursion will "button" out at a leaf node.If the leaf node
      is a goal node,it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal node, it is
      not solvable.This is our base case .In the above code, this is done by the
      lines
    </p>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4">
        if n is a leaf node{
            if the leaf is a goal node,return true
            else return false
        }
    </pre>
    <ul>
      <li><h2>To search a tree:</h2></li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If the tree consists of a single leaf,test whether it is a goal node.
      </li>
      <li>
        Otherwise,search the subtrees untill you find one containing a goal
        node, or untill you have seacrhed them all unsuccessfully.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h2>
    <p>
      Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive
      algorithm can be rewritten a s a stack algorithm. In fact, that is how
      your recursive algorithm are translated into machine or assembly language.
    </p>

    <pre style="color: #007eb4">
        boolean solve(Node n){
            put node n on the Stack;
            while the stack is not empty{
                if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf{
                    if it is goal node, return true
                    else pop it off the stack
                }
                else{
                    if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                    push the next untried child onto the stack
                else pop the node off the stack

                }
                return false
            }
    </pre>
    <p>
      Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack
      are the children offthe node currently on the top of the stack, and these
      are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at
      all times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the
      stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodestamong their
      descendents. Therefore if thie root node gets removed (making the stack
      empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the
      problem.<br /><br />
      When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack
      form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal node<br /><br />
      Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path
      information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of rec√∫rsive
      calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node
      at a time, by (for instance) printing the node lat the current level, or
      storing it in an array.<br /><br />
      Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print
      (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:
    </p>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4">
        boolean solve (Node n){
            if n is a leaf node{
                if the leaf is a goal node{
                    print n
                    return true
                }
                else rerurn false
            }else{
                for each child c of n {
                    if solve(c) succeeds{
                        print n
                        return true
                        }
                    }
                    return false
                }
            }
                    
     </pre

    <h2>Keeping backtracking simple</h2>
    <p>
      All of these versions of the backtracking algonthm are pretty simole, but
      when applied to a reai problem, they can get pretty cluttered up with
      details Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be compiex<br /><br />
      for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame
      problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solutions<br /><br />
      To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in
      methods. In a chess game, for example, youcould fest whether a node is a
      leaf by writing a <b>gameOver method</b> (or you could even call it <b>isLeaf)</b>. This
      method would encapsulate af the ugly details of figuring out whether any
      possible moves remain<br /><br />
      Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each
      node on the current path, which of its children have been tried already
      (so we don't have to try them again. in the above code we made this look
      simple, by just saying <b>for each child c of n.</b> in reality, it may be
      difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be
      no dovious way to step through them in chess, for exampie, a node can
      represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of
      that node can represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal
      move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which
      ones you've already examined?<br /><br />
      The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node
      have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the bode (that is,
      when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As
      you try each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty, there
      are no remaining uptried chedren, and you can return "Tature* This is a
      simple approach, but it may require I quite a lot of additional work.<br /><br />
      There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if
      you can define an ordering on the chidren. if there is an ordering, and
      you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try
      next.<br /><br />
      For example, you might be able to number the <b>children 1 through n,</b> and try
      them in numerical order. Then, if you have just trled <b>child k,</b> you know
      that you have already tried children 1 through <b>k-1,</b> and you have not yet
      tried chadren <b>k+1</b> through <b>n.</b> Or, if you are trying to color a map with
      just four colors, you can always try <b>red first, then yellow, then green,
      then blue.</b> If child yellow fails you know to try child green next if you
      are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight,
      right<b> (or perhaps north, east, south, west).</b><br /><br />
      it isnt alvays easy to find a simpie way to order the children of a node.
      <b>In the chess game example,</b> you might number your pieces for perhaps the
      souares of the board) and try them in numerical order, but in addition
      each piece may also have several and these must also be ordered
    </p>
    
     
      <h2>Example:Tree Search </h2>
      <p> 
      For starters, let's do the simplest posipble example of
      backtracking, wich is searching an actual tree. We will also use the
      simplest kind of tree.<br> <br>
      A binary tree A binary tree is a data structure
      composed of nodes One node is designated as the root node. Each node can
      reference (paint to) zero, one, or tiwo other nodes, which are called its
      childrun. The chidren are referred to as the left child and/or the right
      child All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node,
      and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of
      the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might
      not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first example in this
      papet (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.</p><br><br>
      <p>Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:</p>
      <pre style="color:#007eb4">
        public class BinaryTree{
          BinaryTree leftChild = null;
          BinaryTree rightChild = null;
          boolean isGoalNode = false;
          String name;

          BinaryTree(String name,BinaryTree left,BinaryTree right,boolean is GoalNode){
            this.name = name;
            leftChild = left;
            rightChild = right;
            this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
          }
        }
      </pre>
      <p> Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which construct the above binary tree.</p>
      <pre style="color:#007eb4">
        static BinaryTree makeTree(){
          BinaryTree root,a,b,c,d,e,f;
          c = new BinaryTree("C",null,null;false);
          d = new BinaryTree("D",null,null;false);
          e = new BinaryTree("E",null,null;false);
          f = new BinaryTree("F",null,null;false);
          a = new BinaryTree("A",null,null;false);
          b = new BinaryTree("B",null,null;false);
          root = new BinaryTree("Root",a,b,false);
          return root;
        }

      </pre>
      <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
      <pre style="color:#007eb4">
        public static void main(String args[]){
           BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
           System.out.printin(solvable(tree));
        }

      </pre>
      <p>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>
      <pre style="color:#007eb4">
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
          /*1*/ if (node == null) return false;
          /*2*/  if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
          /*3*/  if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
          /*4*/  if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
          /*5*/  return false; 
        }  
      </pre>
      <p>
        Here's what the numbered lines are doing:

      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the children of a node, without
          first checking whether those children actually exist.</li>
        <li>If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li>
        <li>See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null
          and is not a goal node, says to</li>
        <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
        <li>Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightning result true.</p>
      <p>Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. An
        alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do. Here's that alternative version:</p>

        <pre style="color:#007eb4">
          static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {

          if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
          
          if (node.leftChild 1= null && solvable(node.leftChiid)) return true;
          if (node.rightChitd != null && soivable(node-rightChild)) return true;
          
          return false;
        }
        </pre>
        <p>I think the first version is simpler , but the second version is slightly more efficient </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>What are the children?</h2>
        <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous
          choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know, both the left and the
          right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without
          recursion.<br><br>
          
          Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter
          how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the
          same color.<br><br>
          
          To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are
          colored.<br><br>
          
          There are two ways to do this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li><br>
            <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of
              countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a
            checkerboard only needs two colors.</p><br>
            <h4>boolean mapisOK()</h4>
            <p>Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.</p><br>

            <h4>boolean okToColor(int row,int column,int color)</h4>
            <p>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.</p><br>

            <h4>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row,int column)</h4>
            <p>Used by both methods to find the next ‚Äúcountry‚Äù (actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkerboard).</p><br>

            <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>
            
            <pre style="color:#007eb4">
              boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) {

                if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return mapisOK();
                
                maplrow]{column} = color;
                
                for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
                Int() next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
                it (exploret(next[0], next{t}, nextColor)) return true;
                
                }
                
                return false;
              }
            </pre>
            <p>Here's the code for method 2:</p>
            <pre style="color:#007eb4">
              boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color) {
                if (row >= NUM_ROWS)retum true;
                if (okToColor(row, column, color)) {
                map[row][column] = color;
                for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
                int[]] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
                if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
                }
              }
              return false;
            }
            </pre>
            <p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think They are equally good.However, the timing informatio suggests otherwise:</p>

          <p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 milisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of

            these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates ail ofits descendents, and this will
            often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, By waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically
            
            guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate chidren (reduce the set of choices), do so!</p>

            <h3>Debugging techniques</h3>
            <p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall
              back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements, These tricks can be
              applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.</p>

              <h4>trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</h4>
              <p>Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably
                want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long
                list of these, i's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries. indenting to show the level of nesting can help.
              </p>

              <h4>trick #2: Use specialized print method for debugging.</h4>
              <p>Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself
                contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.<br>
                
                Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs.
                the proportions will be better.
                </p>

                <pre style="color:#007eb4">
                  static String indent =
                  
                  static String name(BinaryTree node) {
                  if (node == null) return null;
                  else return node.name;
                 }

                 static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
                  System.out.printin(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");
                  indent = indent + "| ";
                 }

                 static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
                  indent = indent.substring(3);
                  System.out.printin(indent + ‚Äúsolvable(" + name(node) + ‚Äú) returns true");
                  return true;
                 }

                static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
                  indent = indent.substring(3);
                  System.out.printin(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false");
                  return false;
              }
                </pre>
                <p>To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:</p>
                <pre style="color:#007eb4">
                  static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
                    enter(node);
                    if (node == null) return no(node);
                    if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node);
                    if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node);
                    if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node);
                    
                    return no(node);
                  }
                </pre>
                <p>
                  And we get these result:<br>

<h4>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statement.</h4>
<p>
  Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug
the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?<br><br>

Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to
your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example,
you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these
changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.<br><br>

The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,
</p>
<pre style="color:#007eb4">
      Static void enter(BinaryTree node){
           if(debugging){
           System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable("+name(node)+")");
           indent = indent+"| ";
        }
     }

      Static boolean yes(BinaryTree node){
           if(debugging){
           indent = indent.substring(3);
           System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ")returns true");
    }
    return true;
    }
      Static boolean no(BinaryTree node){
           if (debugging){
           indent = indent.substring(3);
           System.out.println + "solvable(" +name(node) +") return false");
     }
     return false;
     }
</pre><br>

<p>In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about
  making your code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the
  controlled code will be discarded.
  </p>

  <h4>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</h4>
  <p>If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message
    printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions.
    However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following
    code
  </p>
  <pre style="color:#007eb4">
    new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);
  </pre>
  <p>Will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally.That is,the above code just acts like a print statement. </p>

  <pre style="color:#007eb4">
      java.lang.Expression: Checkpoint Charlie

  <h4>Example: Cindy's Puzzle</h4>
  <p>I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You have some number n of black marbles and the same number
    of white marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of 2n+1 spaces to put the marbles in. Start with
    the black marbles all at one end (say, the left), the white marbles all at the other end, and a free space in between.
  </p>

        <td width="45"></td>
        <td><img src="./white-ball.png" alt="whiteball"></td>
        <td><img src="./white-ball.png" alt="whiteball"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>

  <p>The goal is reverse teh positions of the marbles:</p>

        <td><img src="./black-ball.png" alt="blackball"></td>
      </tr>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>

  <p><b>The black marbles can only move to the right and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing up).At each move, amarble can either:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Move one space ahead, if taht spaces is clear, or</li>
    <li>Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space just beyond that marble is clear</li>

  <p>
    The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,
which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.<br><br>

Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the
puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to
print out the bad news.<br>

The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf,
which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.<br><br>

Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board
position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node.
Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.<br><br>

Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of
approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way | worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find
a different but equally valid approach.<br><br>

First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump,
it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and
check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require
having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the
board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive.<br><br>

Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a
particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that
must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight
complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbies) stay in one place.<br><br>

<b>Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each
space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int
position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible</li>
  <li>If the Position contains a back marble,the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
  <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We write another method <b>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</b> that will take a board and a position, make a move from
    that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board,
    rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is ‚Äúapplicative‚Äù
    rather than ‚Äúmutative.‚Äù
    
    Along with <b>can Move and makeMove,</b> we are using methods <b>puzzleSolved and printBoard</b> with meanings that
    should be obvious.
</p>

<pre style="color:#007eb4">
  boolean solvable(int[] board) {
    if (puzzleSolved(board)) {
    return true;
    }
    for (int position = 0; position < BOARD_SIZE; position++) {
    if (canMove(board, position)) {
    int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position);
    if (solvable(newBoard)) {
    printBoard(newBoard);
    return true;
    }
</pre>

<p>Along with canMove, we are using methods puzzleSolved and printBoard with meanings that should be obvious.<br><br>
  Here is some output from the program:

</p>

<p> <i style="color:blue">16.</i> <b>WHITE WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK BLACK BLACK</b></p>
<p> <i style="color:blue">15.</i> <b>WHITE WHITE WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK BLACK</b></p>
<p> <i style="color:blue">14.</i> <b>WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</b></p>
<p> <i style="color:blue">13.</i> <b>WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</b></p>
<p> <i style="color:blue">12.</i> <b>WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE</b></p>
<p> <i style="color:blue">11.</i> <b>WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ BLACK</b></p>
<p> <i style="color:blue">10.</i> <b>WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK _____</b></p>
<p> <i style="color:blue">9.</i> <b>WHITE WHITE WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE</b></p>
<p> <i style="color:blue">8.</i> <b>WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</b></p>
<p> <i style="color:blue">7.</i> <b>_____ BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</b></p>
<p> <i style="color:blue">6.</i> <b>BLACK _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</b></p>
<p> <i style="color:blue">5.</i> <b>BLACK BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE</b></p>
<p> <i style="color:blue">4.</i> <b>BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ WHITE WHITE</b></p>
<p> <i style="color:blue">3.</i> <b>BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ WHITE WHITE</b></p>
<p> <i style="color:blue">2.</i> <b>BLACK BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE WHITE WHITE</b></p>
<p> <i style="color:blue">1.</i> <b>BLACK BLACK BLACK _____ WHITE WHITE WHITE</b></p>

<p>
  Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in the last
line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces its
results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again to get
them in the correct order.
